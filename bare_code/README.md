===================

This is the source directory if you want to run the code on the display's themselves. Running make.sh (linux) or make.bat (windows) will compile the project and program it to your board if you have an usbasp connected, otherwise the upload step will fail. If the upload step failed because you have another programmer simply change the make file accordingly.
